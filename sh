Warning: postcss-cssnext found a duplicate plugin ('autoprefixer') in your postcss plugins. This might be inefficient. You should remove 'autoprefixer' from your postcss plugin list since it's already included by postcss-cssnext.
Note: If, for a really specific reason, postcss-cssnext warnings are irrelevant for your use case, and you really know what you are doing, you can disable this warnings by setting  'warnForDuplicates' option of postcss-cssnext to 'false'.
